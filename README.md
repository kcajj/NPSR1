# Objective

This repository contains the project that was part of the final exam of the "Proteomes, Interactomes and Biological Networks" course of Genomics Bachelor's degree. The objective of the project was to use the resources and tools that were presented during the course applied to real world problems. We decided to study the interaction between NPSR1 (a G-protein coupled receptor) ans NPS (a neuropeptide).
