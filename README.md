This repository contains the project that was part of final exam of the "Proteomes, Interactomes and Biological Networks" course of Genomics Bachelor's degree. The objective was to use the resources and tools that were presented during the course to a real world problem. We decided to study the interaction between NPSR1 (a G-protein coupled receptor) with NPS (a neuropeptide).
